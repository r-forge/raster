23-Aug-2010, version 1.4-5

Setting the nodata value with NAvalues now also affects reading of values from netcdf files (suggested by Steven Mosher)
cellStats now returns values per layer (rather than all combined) (suggested by Steven Mosher)
Minor bug fix in rasterToPoints with multi-layer objects (reported by Jon Olav Skoien).
-------------------------------------------------------------
20-Aug-2010, version 1.4-4

Minor bug fixes in crop (reported by Jon Olav Skoien) and in focalNA (reported by Matteo Mattiuzzi)
Changes in gridDistance to avoid it (igraph) from crashing when using very complex grids.
-------------------------------------------------------------
14-Aug-2010, version 1.4-2

Added @data@gain and @data@offset slots to Raster* objects and use these when reading values from file
v = v * r@gain + r@offset  (suggestion by Jonathan Greenberg)

It is now possible to do Arith (e.g. addition, multiplication) with a RasterStack or Brick using a vector argument of lenght that equals nlayers(object).
E.g. you can mutliply a RasterStack with 5 layers with vector c(1,3,5,3,1), where indices are matched to layers.

It is also possible to do Arith & Math with mutliple RasterStackBrick objects (as long as nlayers is the same) and with a RasterStack/Brick and a RasterLayer objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------
4-Aug-2010, version 1.3-10

Expanded sampleRandom by adding a 'cells' and 'extent' argument; 

-------------------------------------------------------------
3-Aug-2010, version 1.3-9

Switched from RNetCDF to ncdf package for netcdf file support

Added three slots to class BasicRaster
unit='vector' ; to store the unit of the layer(s), e.g. kg m-2 s-1
zname='character' ; to store the name of the z (layers) variable, e.g. "time"
zvalue='vector' ; to store the values of the z variable, e.g. the dates corresponding to each later
These slots are now filled for values from netcdf files with "CF" type convention (e.g. cmip), with an attempt to covert "days since" to a Date (coverted to string).
Not yet used in writing, or with other formats

-------------------------------------------------------------
2-Aug-2010, version 1.3-8

New clump function, now always using igraph (also for large rasters) & minor bug fix

Fixes to subs function (needs more checking)

To allow for better behaviour when using objects derived from Raster* objects (perhaps in other packages), replaced code like
  if (class(x) == 'RasterLayer') 
with
  if (inherits(x, 'RasterLayer'))

Bug fix: error when indexing a RasterStack as in s[1]  (as reported by Kevin Ummel)

-------------------------------------------------------------
