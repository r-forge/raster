improved speed of disaggregate and expand for large files (processing by block of rows rather than by row)
simplified pbCreate
new function for using clusters with raster functions: clusterR
new .detectCores function (taken from the new (R 2.14-0) parallel package)

re-implemented merge and mosaic for higher speed (by block rather than by row).
re-implemented mean, min and max for higher speed
blockSize now tries to respect the gdal reported block size for (hopefully) faster reading (re-implemented rasterFromGDAL to accomodate this)

reclass now has option 'right=NA' (apart from right=TRUE or right=FALSE) to allow intervals to be closed at the left and right side. It is now also possible to provide a two column relassification matrix ("is-becomes") (suggestions by Agustin Lobo). 

--- 12-October-2011, version 1.9-27
Functions re-implemented using C routines for better speed: focal (a combination of old functions focal, focalNA and focalFilter), distance, direction, reclass and slopeAspect.
reclass has changed a bit. Intervals are more rigorously defined (see arguments 'right' and 'include.lowest'), as in 'cut'
slopeAspect is replaced by 'terrain' to do slope, aspect and other elevation derived terrain characteristics.

mask now works for the a RasterStack/Brick and Spatial* objects. Bug reported by Robert Buitenwerf

--- 23-September-2011, version 1.9-19
option "useRaster" to plot. To use 'image' rather than 'rasterImage', because rasterImage not working on some platforms (windows server); in R versions above 2.13.0. The default is FALSE because 'image' is not working well in R 2.13.1 (it draws white lines over the image); but this was fixed in 2.13.1-patched and above.
Bug fix: new plot argument 'addfun' interfered with old argument 'add' such that 'add=T' did not work (reported by Achilleas Psomas)
Big speed gain (~50 times) for 'calc' with a RasterLayer. calc used apply(x, 1, fun) (which is more natural for RasterStackBrick objects), where it simply could use fun(x). This can now be tested using (currently undocumented) arguments forcefun=TRUE or forceapply=TRUE

--- 15-September-2011, version 1.9-13
Removed backwards compatibility issue (x <- normalizePath(x)  instead of x <- normalizePath(x, winslash = "/", FALSE), when creating raster from file). Reported by Julian Zeidler.

Bug fix: pairs did not show the correlation coefficient where there were NA values (reported by Jane Elith)
Improved handling of multifile ncdf files & varname argument, suggested by Matt Fischer. 
cluster support for raster::predict function (run beginCluster() before using predict); but so far this seems to slow things down! 
Much improved speed of the extract function for Raster objects with many layers. Low speed was a problem reported by Jan Verbesselt

plot now uses rasterImage instead of image
Replacement functions implemented for RasterStack/Brick objects (e.g., x[x<1] <- NA )

bug fix in flip(x, 'y') for x is RasterStackBrick when writing to disk
removed gplot and plot3D functions. These are now in the rasterVis package
added linear and histogram stretch options to plotRGB; based on Josh Gray's code in http://spatiallyexplicit.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/crop-circles/

A warning is given when a rotated image is used (suggested by Agustin Lobo)
New function 'rectify' to unrotate rasters
Very limited initial support for rotated rasters (typically sat images). Many of the existing functions will work with these images, but results can be wrong. Should work OK for simple raster algebra etc. but probably not when joining data spatially.  Although basic extract with coordinates should work OK now.

Changes to stackSelect to allow (optionally recycled) layer selection with a multi-layer object

Minor bug fixes in ncdf/brick handling
Bug fixes in dropLayer for a RasterBrick (reported by Steven Mosher)
Added option 'setfileext' (default TRUE) to turn off the automatic setting of the file extension when writing raster files (based on the format). (requested by Jonathan Greenberg)

bug fixes: 
writing via gdal did not respond to the 'options' argument (reported by Tom Kurkowski and  Jorrel Aunario)

Added @data@gain and @data@offset slots to Raster* objects and use these when reading values from file
v = v * r@gain + r@offset  (suggestion by Jonathan Greenberg)
It is now possible to do Arith (e.g. addition, multiplication) with a RasterStack or Brick using a vector argument of lenght that equals nlayers(object).
E.g. you can mutliply a RasterStack with 5 layers with vector c(1,3,5,3,1), where indices are matched to layers.
It is also possible to do Arith & Math with mutliple RasterStackBrick objects (as long as nlayers is the same) and with a RasterStack/Brick and a RasterLayer objects.

--- 12-Aug-2010, version 1.3-11
Expanded sampleRandom by adding a 'cells' and 'extent' argument; 
Switched from RNetCDF to ncdf package for netcdf file support
Added three slots to class BasicRaster
unit='vector' ; to store the unit of the layer(s), e.g. "kg m-2 s-1"
zname='character' ; to store the name of the z (layers) variable, e.g. "time"
zvalue='vector' ; to store the values of the z variable, e.g. the dates corresponding to each later
These slots are now filled for values from netcdf files with "CF" type convention (e.g. cmip), with an attempt to covert "days since" to a Date (coverted to string).
Not yet used in writing, or with other formats
New clump function, now always using igraph (also for large rasters) & minor bug fix
Fixes to subs function (needs more checking)
To allow for better behaviour when using objects derived from Raster* objects (perhaps in other packages), replaced code like
  if (class(x) == 'RasterLayer') 
with
  if (inherits(x, 'RasterLayer'))
Bug fix: error when indexing a RasterStack as in s[1]  (as reported by Kevin Ummel)
