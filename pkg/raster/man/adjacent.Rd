\title{Adjacent cells}

\description{
Identify cells that are adjacent to a set of cells on a raster. See \code{\link{adjacency}} for an alternative implementation.
}

\usage{
adjacent(x, cells, directions=4, pairs=TRUE, target) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Raster* object}
  \item{cells}{vector of cell numbers for which adjacent cells should be found}
  \item{directions}{the number of directions in which cells should be connected: 4 (rook's case), 8 (queen's case), 16, or 'bishop'. Or a neigborhood matrix (see Details)}
  \item{pairs}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, a matrix of pairs of adjacent cells is returned. If \code{FAlSE}, a vector of cells adjacent to \code{from} is returned (perhaps intersected with \code{to})}
  \item{target}{Optional. Vector of target cell numbers that should be considered. All other adjacent cells are ignored}
 }

\details{
A neighborhood matrix indentifies the cells around each cell that are considered adjacent. The matrix should have one, and only one, cell with value 0 (the focal cell); at least one cell with value 1 (the adjacent cell(s)); All other cells are not considered adjacent and ignored.

Cell numbers start with 1 in the upper-left corner and increase from left to right and from top to bottom.
}


\value{
matrix or vector with adjacent cells.
