\title{ Create a RasterBrick object}

\description{
A RasterBrick is a multi-layer raster object. They are typically created from a multi-band file; but they can also exist entirely in memory. They are similar to a RasterStack, but processing time should be shorter when using a RasterBrick. Yet they are less flexible as they can only point to a single file.

A RasterBrick can be created from RasterLayer objects, from a RasterStack, or from a file. The can also be created from SpatialPixels and SpatialGrid objects.
