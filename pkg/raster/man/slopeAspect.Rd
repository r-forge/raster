\title{Slope and aspect}

\description{
Compute slope and/or aspect from elevation data. Elevation data should be in map units (typically meter for projected raster data), or in meters when the coordinate reference system (CRS) is longitude/latitude. 
}

\usage{
slopeAspect(dem, filename='', type='', unit='', neighbors=8, ...)  
}

\arguments{
  \item{dem}{RasterLayer object with elevation values in map units, or in meters when the crs is longitude/latitude}
  \item{filename}{Character. Filename. optional}
  \item{type}{Character. 'slope', 'aspect', or 'both' (=default, slope and aspect)}
  \item{unit}{Character. 'degrees' or '' (=default, radians for aspect, and fraction for slope) }
  \item{neighbors}{Integer. Indicating how many neighboring cells to use to compute slope for any cell. Either 8 (queen case) or 4 (rook case), see Details.}
  \item{...}{Standard additional arguments for writing RasterLayer files}
}

\details{
When neighbors==4, slope and aspect are computed according to Fleming and Hoffer (1979) and Ritter (1987). When neigbors==8, slope and aspect are computed according to Horn (1981). The Horn algorithm may be best for rough surfaces, and the Fleming and Hoffer algorithm may be better for smoother surfaces (Jones, 1997; Burrough and McDonnell, 1998).
