\title{Terrain characteristics}

\description{

Compute slope, aspect and other terrain characteristics from a raster with elevation data. The elevation data should be in map units (typically meter) for projected (planar) raster data. They should be in meters when the coordinate reference system (CRS) is longitude/latitude. 

This function is the replacement for the depracated function \code{\link{slopeAspect}}
}

\usage{
terrain(x, filename='', opt='', unit='radians', neighbors=8, ...)  
}


\arguments{
  \item{x}{RasterLayer object with elevation values. Values should have the same unit as the map units, or in meters when the crs is longitude/latitude}
  \item{filename}{Character. Filename. optional}
  \item{opt}{Character vector containing one or more of these options: slope, aspect, TPI, TRI, roughness (see Details)}
  \item{unit}{Character. 'degrees' or 'radians'. Only relevant for slope and aspect }
  \item{neighbors}{Integer. Indicating how many neighboring cells to use to compute slope for any cell. Either 8 (queen case) or 4 (rook case). Only used for slope and aspect, see Details}
  \item{...}{Standard additional arguments for writing Raster* objects to file}
}


\details{
When \code{neighbors=4}, slope and aspect are computed according to Fleming and Hoffer (1979) and Ritter (1987). When \code{neigbors=8}, slope and aspect are computed according to Horn (1981). The Horn algorithm may be best for rough surfaces, and the Fleming and Hoffer algorithm may be better for smoother surfaces (Jones, 1997; Burrough and McDonnell, 1998).
If slope = 0, aspect is set to 0.5*pi radians (or 90 degrees if unit='degrees'). When computing slope or aspect, the CRS (\code{\link{projection}}) of the RasterLayer \code{x} must be known (may not be \code{NA}), to be able to safely differentiate between planar and longitude/latitude data.


The terrain indices are according to Wilson et al. (2007), as in \href{http://www.gdal.org/gdaldem.html}{gdaldem}. TRI (Terrain Ruggedness Index) is the mean of the absolute differences between the value of a cell and the value of its 8 surrounding cells. TPI (Topographic Position Index) is the difference between the value of a cell and the mean value of its 8 surrounding cells. Roughness is the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of a cell and its 8 surrounding cells.

Such measures can also be computed with the \code{\link{focal}} function:

\code{f <- matrix(1, nrow=3, ncol=3)}

\code{TRI <- focal(x, w=f, fun=function(x, ...) sum(abs(x[-5]-x[5]))/8 )}

\code{TPI <- focal(x, w=f, fun=function(x, ...) x[5] - mean(x[-5]))}

\code{rough <- focal(x, w=f, fun=function(x, ...) max(x) - min(x))}
}
